a = b * 2;

// * Mathematic operation or a task
// * Go from Right to Left
// * Break it apart
//     * 2 = literal value (no interpretation required)
//     * * = Multiplication operator
//     * b variable = It is a variable, it is not a keyword
//         * If a word which does not have a special meaning then it is a variable (identifier)
//         *  Symbolic representation, if b has a value, program would ask to find the value of the variable and replace it with b
//     * b*2 is an expression
//     * = : is a special kind of operator known as assignment operator
//         * Itâ€™s responsibility is 
//             * SOURCE VALUE: to take the value of the expression on the right hand side 
//             * TARGET VALUE: and put it on the left hand side
//         * Compute the value on RHS b*2 and put it in a
// * Coherent grouping of
//     * a
//     * =
//     * b*2
//     * Known as ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT
